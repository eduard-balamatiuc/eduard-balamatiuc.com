So, you want to know the story behind this little corner of the internet? Let me take you on a journey through the git history, a tale of commits, frustrations, and small victories.

It all started with the most basic of pages - just some HTML, a microscopic amount of CSS, and the birth of the first dispatches. Commit after commit, I was just trying to make something that wouldn't embarrass me too much when I showed it to my Web Programming teacher (again, shout out to [@strdr4605](https://github.com/strdr4605)).

From commit `83e1fa7` to `d13b613` - the dark days of styling. Only my keyboard and my editor know what happened during those hours. It was pain and struggle and hard typing, copy pasting from different internet sites and trying to understand what the heck is going on. CSS is both a blessing and a curse, especially when you're figuring out the right shades of `--bg-color` and `--text-color` to make your eyes not bleed when looking at the screen at 2 AM.

Then came the great icon path disaster of commit `301820f` to `9a02407`. Who knew that a simple forward slash could cause so much trouble? Paths are supposed to be straightforward, but they turned into a labyrinth of trial and error. The browser console was in love with 404 errors, silently judging my inability to properly reference a simple favicon. Looking back at it now, I should have just started directly with Astro.

The theme toggle functionality (commit `38588dd`) was a moment of pride. Dark mode was it's own lifestyle. The satisfaction of clicking that little button and watching the colors invert was worth it ahahah.

The [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) is a blessing.

From commits `804669e` to `37d46a5`, the grand architecture refactoring happened. Creating the BaseLayout and MarkdownDispatchLayout finally felt so clear and obvious, it was almost as obvious as writing Python code, just moments of
"Oh yeah, I get it now" and "Why didn't I do this earlier? This makes so much sense".

The star feature (commits `273096d` to `187d89b`) was when things got serious. Adding interactivity, persistence through localStorage, and those subtle hover effects - this is when I started to feel like maybe, just maybe, I wasn't completely terrible at this web development thing. Now I still might play with the star to actually be centered with the text, but that's for another time.

And here we are now, another dispatch added to the collection. The site is still far from perfect, but it's mine - bugs, awkward styling, and all. As Theo suggested, ship it first, then iterate.

dispatch_output: The dark mode toggle is lowkey so satisfying.
