Hi there!

I got no idea how you got here, like the probability of you being here is either that you're my Web Programing teacher that reviews my work at the moment (shout out to @strdr4605 if this blog ever gets lost of viewers ahahahah, he allowed me to combine one of my laboratory works with a task I had in my todo's for some time) or maybe you were just randomly browsing and stalking (lmaoo) through my profiles, you intersected with this link and decided that it might be a good idea to click it.

Now just so we make things clear, I am not sure how consistent I am going to be with the content from here but as Naval Ravikant said in one recent podcast I watched with him and Chirs Williamson and also in his Almanack, do things when you're inspired about it, I have the inspiration now, I am doing it now, not sure how or why or whatever but here it is, this should also be one of the first commits into this repo so if you got here yep, this is the second commit on this website.

There is just so so much stuff I learn and interact and do throughout my days, and sometimes things might be to technical to share with all my friends and family and other stuff so this place on the internet will have that goal, just sharing stuff that I do, things that I learn and all that stuff.

For everyone outthere, I am an amateur, so if you're my employer or whatever company or idk, yeah this is me, I am never planning on being a professional, an advanced amateur is what I dream of being, just a random dude.

This is the rawest thoughts you could ever extract from me, at least in the current state, I talk a lot at least when I got my inspiration along my side, probably not always in real life (I consider myself as an introvert with some socializign skills)

anyways, I'll keep it short, today is April 8 2025
