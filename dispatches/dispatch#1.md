So this site website page call it whatever, will be my laboratory work, at least in until I present it to my teacher and I got a requirement of using Astro build for it. 

For some context on my experience, well I don't have any, like almost not at all, I did some bad looking html based pages when I was in middle school and high school but at that point my experience stopped ahahaha.

Then I did some projects with some generated code, with some pretty bad attempts if I could say so. Except my last one, it was kind of generated and with some team work from @grumpycatyo-collab. In case you're curious, it was for a hackathon project, here is the [repo](https://github.com/eduard-balamatiuc/stiu)

Now there is this guy on youtube called Theo, I like his stuff, great way of humanly explaining things (if you're curious here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg)) and he once said in a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/c-hKSbzooAg?si=v4ObgVvoRF2OEGrY) about recreating drive that he thinks we should try to deploy your projects as soon as possible and I do agree with that so you're gonna see that probably in the next 5 commits.

dispatch_output: Deploy first, then iterate.
